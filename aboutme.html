  <strong>
    I have done my schooling in <br />
    Little Star High School, Shantinagar, Adilabad.
    <br />
    I don't say that my hobbies are reading novels, <br />
    sitting in library and ending up my day studying because I don't really do
    so.
    <br />
    My hobbies are watching science fiction movies browsing YouTube <br />
    and I usually listen music in my free time. <br />
    I am always interested in indulging myself in some Technology related
    things.
    <br />
    My career goal is seeking a job opportunity as a <br />
    software engineer in a dynamic firm like Apple
